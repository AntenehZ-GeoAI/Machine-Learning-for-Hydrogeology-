# Machine Learning for Hydrogeology

## Project Overview
This repository applies machine learning techniques to hydrogeological problems, including groundwater flow, salinity prediction, and contamination modeling. The goal is to develop models that improve predictions using available hydrological data.

## Key Features
- Uses ML models like LSTMs, Random Forest, and XGBoost for prediction
- Data preprocessing for handling missing values and scaling
- Model evaluation using R², RMSE, and MAE
- Basic visualizations for model results

## Dataset
The dataset includes hydrological and climatic variables such as:
- Rainfall, temperature, evapotranspiration, and pumping rates
- Groundwater levels and salinity concentration

Data sources are from publicly available hydrological records or research datasets.
